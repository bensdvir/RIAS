Each program uses two folders: resources folder and outputs folder.

The file 'categoriesSentences' contains division of the data per category.
The 'composites' file contains the calculated composites that were calculated during the running of the program. 
In each iteration, I create 'comparison' file wich includes 'comparison' between our prediction and the real category for each utterance in the test data,
'graph' file representing the graph of the test data,, and 'visualmatrix' file contains the dry conclusions per category (recall, TP ratio and more)

Finally, the interesting part of the code is found on 'kFoldNueralNetwork'. In this function we are extracting the features from the data, creating the models ,generate 
conclusions and create the files mentioned above.
